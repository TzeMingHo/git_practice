* ## Project name: 
        
        Motivative movie lines

* ## Description: 

        This is a message generator that randomly quotes motivational lines from movies. In recent years, the world has been plagued by wars, viruses, and political crackdowns that have made it increasingly difficult for people to pursue their dreams. However, I find inspiration in the characters of movies who struggle and suffer but never give up on their dreams. I hope that this message generator can also kindle your fire, even during tough times.
